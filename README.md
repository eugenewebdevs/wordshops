## About

[Eugene Web Devs](https://eugenewebdevs.com/) is putting together tech workshops! 🎉 👏 🎉

The plan is to have three workshops with the following goals:

* Introduce more web developers to cloud services (mainly AWS because of ease of set up and free tier services 🆓 ).
* Introduce web developers to interactions beyond front end or back end.
* Collaboration with various other meetup groups within the Eugene community. 👫 👬 👭

You can help with the organization of a workshop, promoting a workshop, or sponsorship.
