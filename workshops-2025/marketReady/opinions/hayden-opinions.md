## Creating Your Portfolio

### Have a Clear Message

- Create a focused message around who you are and stick to it. All of your content, be it copy, images, design, projects, etc. should all relate in a cohesive way to your message.
- Optimize you messaging towards the users of your portfolio f.e. potential employers, or clients.
- Don't have multiple messages. This will break the cohesion of the portfolio. It's okay to emphasize more than one point, but it should back the overarching story. F.e. I am a tutor, designer, developer, and manager, but my central message is that I am an expert who can and loves to create things digitally.

### Don't Overdo It

- This is the first increment, it doesn't have to be perfect and it won't be. Don't try to create a masterpiece.
- What's important is that your creating something that can be improved on and will not collect dust on the shelf.
- Keep your scope small and reasonable and as ideas come up record them, but don't go off on a tangent that will prevent you from finishing. You have one day to build this increment.
- Keep organized, I highly suggest Github and using Github issues to track features you want to work on. If going low-code or no code you can use Notion, docs, or something else.

### Clean and Simple Beats Fancy and Cluttered

- A big part of having a clear message is users being able to easily read or even skim it.
- Keep the most important stuff towards the top. The first view people see (opening fold) is the most valuable real estate on your site, put your most important stuff there.
- You don't need to say everything. Keep explanations concise especially on the homepage. Pick a couple projects to feature, other projects and full explanations of projects can be pushed to back pages where only the most interested people can find them.
- No walls of text (unless on back pages), these scare people away, think of how you can convey your point in less words.
